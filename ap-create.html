            <h2>BOUNCING BALL GAME</h2>
            <p>My program is written in Popcode using the javaScrpit and p5.js library. My code was created using the Popcode development environment. The purpose of my game is to keep the ball bouncing for as long as possible. In this video clip, you can
                see how my game consists of the ball changing its speed and color. There is a timer keeping track of the time the player is able to keep the ball going using a paddle, which is managed by the mouse, causing the ball to bounce off. </p>
            <p>My partner and I used iterative pair programming by writing together the ball and set up function. By myself I wrote the code for the paddle, timer, and speed functions. The first developmental challenge I encountered was making sure that
                my paddle didn’t leave the canvas. I solved this challenge by creating boundaries around the edges of the bottom of my canvas. The second developmental challenge I encountered was figuring out how to get my ball to change color every time
                the mouse gets clicked. I solved this challenge by creating a function called mousePressed. Using RGB colors, I put the fill of the ball to random(255) for R, G, and B.
            </p>
            <ul>function paddleBounce() { </ul>
            <ul> if (ypos >= height - 25) {</ul>
            <ul>if (xpos
                <=x poshand + 65 && xpos>= xposhand - 65) {</ul>
            <ul>if (yspeed
                < 10 && yspeed> -10) {</ul>
            <ul>yspeed = yspeed * (-1.2);</ul>
            <ul>} else {</ul>
            <ul> yspeed = yspeed * (-1.01);</ul>
            <ul>}</ul>

            <p>The purpose of this block of code is to keep the ball moving around. When this function paddleBounce runs correctly, it makes the ball bounce off of the paddle that is located at the bottom of the screen. The algorithm is able to achieve this
                result by once the ball hits the paddle it makes the ball change its x and y position depending on where the paddle is located on the bottom. It also changes the speed of the ball by -1.2 or -1.02 every time it happens. I chose this speed
                because it wasn’t a big number to reduce the speed. If this program did not include this algorithm, the game would not work a expected. That would mean that the ball would not bounce off the paddle everytime it touches it. Therefore without
                the ball bouncing around, the game would be over. This algorithm works with the function timerS and the function mousePressed. The subalgorithm timerS keeps track of the number of seconds the player lasts playing the game before it is
                over. The subalgorithm mousePressed changes the color of the ball once the mouse is clicked.
            </p>
            <ul>function ballSpeed() {</ul>
            <ul>xpos += xspeed;</ul>
            <ul>ypos += yspeed;</ul>
            <ul>if (xpos
                <=2 5 || xpos>= width -25) {</ul>
            <ul> if (xspeed
                < 10 && xspeed> -10) {</ul>
            <ul> xspeed = xspeed * (-1.2);</ul>
            <ul> } else {</ul>
            <ul> xspeed = xspeed * (-1.01);</ul>
            <ul> }</ul>
            <ul> }</ul>
            <ul> if (ypos
                <=2 5) {</ul>
                    <ul> if (yspeed
                        < 10 && yspeed> -10) {</ul>
                    <ul> yspeed = yspeed * (-1.2);</ul>
                    <ul> } else {</ul>
                    <ul> yspeed = yspeed * (-1.01);</ul>
                    <ul> }</ul>
                    <ul> }</ul>
                    <ul>}</ul>

                    <p> An example of an abstraction in my program is my function ballSpeed. This simplifies my program by making the ball bounce off the edges and controlling the speed of it. I created this function to put together all of the movements the
                        ball makes while the game is running. If this abstraction weren’t present, then this program wouldn’t work because the ball wouldn't move.
