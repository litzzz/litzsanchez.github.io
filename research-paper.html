            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p> Today, obesity affects about 69% of Americans, which means that it is more than one-third of the population in the United States. Obesity is when a person has excessive amounts of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is the body fat found all over
                the body. This can eventually lead up to type two diabetes or even death. The negative impact of obesity has been worsening over the years but so far there hasn't been a sign of relief. It is difficult for people with obesity to lose weight
                based just on lifestyle changes. Wearable devices are a method that can help control, reduce, or even get rid of obesity.
            </p>
            <p> meals taste so good to people, they tend to ignore the number of calories it has. Wearable devices are small devices that include sensors to collect and deliver information from the user. Examples of the information that's being collected
                would be related to health, fitness, or locations. These wearable devices may rely on wireless systems like bluetooth or wifi setups. The most well known are the Apple Watch by Apple and Google Glass by Google, but the Apple Watch is the
                most used. They help out people by keeping them updated about their physical activity and health.
