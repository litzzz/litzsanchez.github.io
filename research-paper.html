            <p> Today, obesity affects about 69% of Americans, which means that it is more than one-third of the population in the United States. Obesity is when a person has excessive amounts of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is the body fat found all over
                the body. This can eventually lead up to type two diabetes or even death. The negative impact of obesity has been worsening over the years but so far there hasn't been a sign of relief. It is difficult for people with obesity to lose weight
                based just on lifestyle changes.

            <p> Meals taste so good to people, they tend to ignore the number of calories it has. Wearable devices are small devices that include sensors to collect and deliver information from the user. Examples of the information that's being collected
                would be related to health, fitness, or locations. These wearable devices may rely on wireless systems like bluetooth or wifi setups. The most well known are the Apple Watch by Apple and Google Glass by Google, but the Apple Watch is the
                most used. They help out people by keeping them updated about their physical activity and health.

                Wearable devices are small devices that include sensors to collect and deliver information from the person who is wearing it. Examples of the information that's being collected would be related to health, fitness, or even locations. These wearable devices
                may rely on wireless systems like bluetooth or wifi setups. The most well known are the Apple Watch by Apple and Google Glass by Google, but the Apple Watch is the most used to keep track of the amount of exercise a person does. They help
                out people by keeping them updated about their daily health.

                Wearable devices are a method used to help patients stay healthy. The data that is collected with these monitors is very helpful for the doctors when they check in with their patients. An article by Quartz stated that, "Through smart algorithms and exception-based
                management protocols within the HealthyCircles platform, a heart-failure patient's blood pressure measurements could trigger an alert for a nurse case manager or doctor to check in on the patient, for example. And patients and family caregivers
                can monitor and manage the patient's health status from home." This means that these wearable devices can help prevent any of these or even worsening. Therefore this shows that wearable devices can be reliable method to reduce any of these
                side effects.
