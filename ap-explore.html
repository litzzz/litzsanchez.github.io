            <p> The computing innovation I chose are credit card chips. The purpose of chip on a card is to provide an extra layer of security on the money the card contains. It works by having data stored in it as if it were a tiny device, for example like
                a computer. This artifact was used to end signature cards. Signature cards were a great way for theifs to make frauds. It was easy to falcicicate a signature.. </p>
            <p>
                The impact of this innovation is on the economy because it contributes to people's wealth in many good ways. This innovation is beneficial because the risks of having rsonal information given to unauthoized peole are lower. These credit card chips make
                it hard for others to get private information without having permission. On the other hand, this innovation is harmful in a way because it doesn't provide security when transactions are being made online. This can lead to becoming a victam
                of a scam.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data my innovation uses is the a bank account and the information it contains. These chips generate people to feel secure everytime they make transactions using their credit card chips. Credit card chips create data by a unique proceeding code that
                won't be able to be used again. A concern about security is that these credit card chips aren't helping reduce credit card frauds. Thieves have found other ways to steal from users online.
